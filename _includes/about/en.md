Hi, My name is Huang Yangzhe. I am currently studying in the Department of Computer Science, Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Very interested in machine learning, data analysis and visualization. Share study notes related to machine learning and data visualization on this blog. I like to exercise, cook, and play guitar during part time.
